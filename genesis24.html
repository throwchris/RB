pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out,
who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's
brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder. <SUP>16</SUP>And the
damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man
known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher,
and came up. <SUP>17</SUP>And the servant ran to meet her, and said,
Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher. <SUP>18</SUP>And
she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher
upon her hand, and gave him drink. <SUP>19</SUP>And when she had
done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels
also, until they have done drinking. <SUP>20</SUP>And she hasted,
and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well
to draw water, and drew for all his camels. <SUP>21</SUP>And the man
wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the Lord had made
his journey prosperous or not. <SUP>22</SUP>And it came to pass, as
the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of
half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels
weight of gold; <SUP>23</SUP>and said, Whose daughter art thou? tell
me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge
in? <SUP>24</SUP>And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel
the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor. <SUP>25</SUP>She said
moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room
to lodge in. <SUP>26</SUP>And the man bowed down his head, and
worshipped the Lord. <SUP>27</SUP>And he said, Blessed be the Lord
God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of
his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the Lord led me to the
house of my master's brethren. <SUP>28</SUP>And the damsel ran, and
told them of her mother's house these things. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in">
<FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><SUP>29</SUP>And Rebekah had a
brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man,
unto the well. <SUP>30</SUP>And it came to pass, when he saw the
earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the
words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me;
that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at
the well. <SUP>31</SUP>And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the
Lord; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the
house, and room for the camels. <SUP>32</SUP>And the man came into
the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender
for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that
were with him. <SUP>33</SUP>And there was set meat before him to
eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And
he said, Speak on. <SUP>34</SUP>And he said, I am Abraham's servant.
<SUP>35</SUP>And the Lord hath blessed my master greatly; and he is
become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver,
and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.
<SUP>36</SUP>And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when
she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath. <SUP>37</SUP>And
my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my
son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell: <SUP>38</SUP>but
thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a
wife unto my son. <SUP>39</SUP>And I said unto my master,
Peradventure the woman will not follow me. <SUP>40</SUP>And he said
unto me, The Lord, before whom I walk, will send his angel with
thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of
my kindred, and of my father's house: <SUP>41</SUP>then shalt thou
be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if
they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath. <SUP>42</SUP>And
I came this day unto the well, and said, O Lord God of my master
Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go; <SUP>43</SUP>behold,
I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when
the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I
pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink; <SUP>44</SUP>and
she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels:
let the same be the woman whom the Lord hath appointed out for my
master's son. <SUP>45</SUP>And before I had done speaking in mine
heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder;
and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto
her, Let me drink, I pray thee. <SUP>46</SUP>And she made haste, and
let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will
give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels
drink also. <SUP>47</SUP>And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter
art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom
Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the
bracelets upon her hands. <SUP>48</SUP>And I bowed down my head, and
worshipped the Lord, and blessed the Lord God of my master Abraham,
which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's
daughter unto his son. <SUP>49</SUP>And now if ye will deal kindly
and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may
turn to the right hand, or to the left. <SUP>50</SUP>Then Laban and
Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the Lord: we
cannot speak unto thee bad or good. <SUP>51</SUP>Behold, Rebekah is
before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's
wife, as the Lord hath spoken. <SUP>52</SUP>And it came to pass,
that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the
Lord, bowing himself to the earth. <SUP>53</SUP>And the servant
brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and
gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother
precious things. <SUP>54</SUP>And they did eat and drink, he and the
men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in
the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master. <SUP>55</SUP>And
her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few
days, at the least ten; after that she shall go. <SUP>56</SUP>And he
said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the Lord hath prospered my
way; send me away that I may go to my master. <SUP>57</SUP>And they
said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth. <SUP>58</SUP>And
they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man?
And she said, I will go. <SUP>59</SUP>And they sent away Rebekah
their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.
<SUP>60</SUP>And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art
our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy
seed possess the gate of those which hate them. <SUP>61</SUP>And
Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and
followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way. </FONT>
